JFrame - link to window
    .add(canvas) does the magic
    other funcs do nothing
    or maybe even, complete no-op and it relies on the canvas constructor?

Canvas - canvas in main window
    .update(Graphics g)
        g points to iframe canvas
        at the end of this, gets blit
    .createBufferStrategy()
    .getBufferStrategy()
        .getGraphics()
    robocode uses both graphics... probably make them point to the same thing?
        and make BufferStrategy.show() only happen once

BufferedImage - canvas in iframe
    inherits from Image
    .getGraphics() -> Graphics2D
Graphics2D - CanvasRenderingContext2D
    inherits from Graphics... hope that works


filesystem images?
